# Functions : A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
# A function can return data as a result.
# Arguments : Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Parameters or Arguments? The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

# Functions are two types : 1. Built-in functions 2. User-defined functions
# Built-in functions : Functions that are built into Python. Examples : print(), len(), range(), sum(), max(), min(), abs(), round(), sorted(), reversed(), etc.
# User-defined functions : Functions that we define ourselves. Examples : calc_sum(), calc_avg(), summing(), etc.

def calc_sum(a, b):
    return a + b 

print(calc_sum(10, 20))
print(calc_sum(100, 200))





# Now 10, 20, 100, 200 are arguments and a, b are parameters.
