"""
To map real world scenarios, we started using objects in code
this is called object oriented programming

1. We used to do procedural programming initially - > which was happening
2. Later we used to do functional programming -> It's got us how to do reusable of the code, redundancy will be reduced and reusability increased
3. Later we are using the Object Oriented Programming -> which will again reduce the redundancy and reusability 

CLASS : Is a blue print of the object 
Object : is an example of the class
