    "## Magic methods or Dunder methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods also known as dunder methods, are special methods in python that begin and ends with the double underscores(__). They allow developers to defie the behaviour of their custom objects for various operations such as addition, subtraction, string representation and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few methods are below :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization and Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__(self, ...)`: Called when an instance is created (the constructor).\n",
    "* `__repr__(self)`: Defines the “official” string representation of an object. Useful for debugging.\n",
    "* `__str__(self)`: Defines the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attribute Access:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__getattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute is not found in the usual places.\n",
    "* `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Called when an attribute assignment is attempted.\n",
    "* `__delattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute deletion is attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Container Emulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__len__(self)`: Defines behavior for the built-in len() function.\n",
    "* `__getitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for indexing.\n",
    "* `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Defines behavior for indexed assignment.\n",
    "* `__delitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for indexed deletion.\n",
    "* `__iter__(self)`: Defines behavior for iteration over the object.\n",
    "* `__contains__(self, item)`: Defines behavior for membership test operators (in and not in).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__add__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the addition operator +.\n",
    "* `__sub__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the subtraction operator -.\n",
    "* `__mul__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the multiplication operator *.\n",
    "* `__truediv__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the division operator /.\n",
    "* `__floordiv__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the floor division operator //.\n",
    "* `__mod__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the modulo operator %.\n",
    "* `__pow__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the exponentiation operator **."

The goal is to provide a string that, if passed to eval(), would (ideally) recreate the original object.\n",
