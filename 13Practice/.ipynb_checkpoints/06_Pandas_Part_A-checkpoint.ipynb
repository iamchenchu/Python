    "Pandas is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Pandas is derived from the econometrics term Panel Data. Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely __Pandas Series__ and __Pandas DataFrame__. These data structures allow us to work with labeled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner. These lessons are intended as a basic overview of Pandas and introduces some of its most important features.\n",

    "* How to import Pandas\n",
    "* How to create Pandas Series and DataFrames using various methods\n",
    "* How to access and change elements in Series and DataFrames\n",
    "* How to perform arithmetic operations on Series\n",
    "* How to load data into a DataFrame\n",
    "* How to deal with Not a Number (NaN) values\n",

    "The following lessons assume that you are already familiar with NumPy and have gone over the previous NumPy lessons. Therefore, to avoid being repetitive we will omit a lot of details already given in the NumPy lessons. Consequently, if you haven't seen the NumPy lessons we suggest you go over them first."
